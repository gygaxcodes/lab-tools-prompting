      "System: You are working within your environment that integrates multiple tools to assist you in complex tasks using Java application with JNI integration capabilities for data analysis. The following is a list of available tools along with their functionalities: \n",
      "1. java_jni_invoke(javaClass: String, methodName: String, argsArray: Object[]) -> Void - Invokes the specified method on a given class in Java via native calls using JNI. This tool can also handle arguments passed as an array of objects and doesn't return any value (Void).\n",
      "2. jni_convert(javaObject: Any) -> String - Converts a Java object to its string representation, which could be helpful for logging or debugging purposes within your application when using JNI calls. This tool returns the converted string as output.\n",
      "3. calculateArrayStatistics(arrayData: Object[]) -> Map<String, Float> - Analyzes an array of numerical data and provides statistics such as sum, mean (average), min, max, standard deviation etc., which are returned in a map with descriptive keys like \"sum\", \"mean\", etc. The output is also keyed to their respective statistical measures represented by float values for the measure type.\n",
      "4. getNativeEnvironmentPath() -> String - Returns the path where your native code environment is set up, this can be useful when you need to access resources or libraries from within JNI calls that interact with C/C++ components of a system-level application such as data analysis algorithms written in performance-critical languages like Fortran.\n",
      "5. java_native_print(javaString: String) -> Void - A wrapper function used for printing Java strings directly into native loggers, potentially bypassing the standard output stream (like System.out). This tool also doesn't return any value as its purpose is to print and does not involve returning a string or numerical result back from JNI calls within your application context.\n",
      "6. callNativeFunction(functionName: String, arg1: Object, ...argN: Object) -> Void - Directly invokes native functions with arguments provided by the user via Java methods in an environment-sensitive manner without using reflection; this tool is meant to simplify JNI interactions that require calling low-level code directly.\n",
      "7. parseJavaStringToDouble(javaString: String) -> Float or Null - Parses a Java string representing numerical data into its double value equivalent, with appropriate handling of potential exceptions and non-numerical inputs resulting in the return being either null if parsing fails for input that's not purely numeric strings (e.g., alphanumeric), otherwise it returns as float type which can be critical when dealing with user inputs or external system data feeds parsed into Java String objects before JNI interaction ensures numerical analysis is accurate and reliable within the native code environment setup in your application for complex tasks such as statistical computations on large datasets.\n",
      "8. java_jni_handleException(exception: Exception) -> Void - Handles exceptions that occur during JNI operations by logging them to a predefined log file or console, allowing Java applications running with this tool not only function seamlessly but also provide insight into any runtime issues encountered when using native libraries and methods.\n",
      "9. jni_accessLibrary(libraryName: String) -> Void - Accesses the specified library via JNI calls within your application environment for tasks like data analysis or mathematical computation that require performance-optimized implementations often written in languages such as C, Fortran, etc., which are beyond Java's default capabilities but can be achieved through carefully structured native code.\n",
      "10. extractJavaMethodInfo(javaClass: String) -> Map<String, Object> - Retrieves metadata about a specified Java class (like method names and their signatures), potentially useful for dynamically invoking methods using JNI calls in situations where reflection might not be an ideal choice or available within the context of your application that leverages this integration.\n",
      "11. java_nativeMath(javaFloat: Float, operation: String) -> Float - A tool designed to perform mathematical operations (like addition and multiplication) on float values by invoking equivalent native methods using JNI calls which might be required in scenarios where high-performance computations are critical within your application for data analysis tasks.\n",
      "12. java_jni_nativeCall(javaClass: String, methodName: String, argArray: Object[]) -> Void - A generalized function that combines the functionality of invoking a Java class's native methods using JNI calls while managing argument arrays as it simplifies and abstracts some common patterns found in direct native method invocation tasks.\n",
      "13. java_nativeStringConversion(javaString: String, toType: String) -> Object - Converts strings between different types (like from string representations of numbers back to numerical data formats), potentially useful for transforming user inputs or system-generated textual outputs into forms that can be directly processed using JNI calls in your application context.\n",
      "14. java_jni_exceptionHandling(javaClass: String, methodName: String, argArray: Object[]) -> Void - A specialized function handling exceptions during the execution of native methods within a Java class after invocation via JNI which may include cleanup or recovery strategies necessary for maintaining robustness in your application when dealing with external libraries and system-level interactions that are crucial for advanced data analysis procedures.\n",
      "15. java_jni_nativeCode(javaClass: String, methodName: String) -> Void - A basic function providing access to native methods within a specific Java class using direct JNI calls; this tool is essential when you need simplicity and efficiency in invoking performance-critical code sections that cannot be achieved with reflection or higher-level abstractions.\n",

      "Question: When working on optimizing the data analysis process of my application, I encounter slow computations while converting large JSON datasets into arrays for further calculations using JNI calls within a Java environment set up to interact directly with native C++ libraries designed specifically for high performance numerical computation tasks like statistical analyses and matrix operations. The current toolset lacks an efficient way to process this conversion without iterating over each line of the dataset manually in Java code, which is highly time-consuming given our data's size.\n",
